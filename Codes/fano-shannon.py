# TODO: Implement the fano-Shannon compression algorithm
# TODO: Define the Data Structure: Decide on the data structure to store symbols and their probabilities/frequencies.
# TODO: Calculate Frequencies: Write a function to calculate the frequency of each symbol in the input data.
# TODO: Sort Symbols: Implement a sorting mechanism to order symbols by their frequencies in descending order.
# TODO: Divide and Conquer: Create a function to recursively divide the sorted list of symbols into two parts, ensuring the sum of probabilities is as equal as possible.Assign binary codes (0 for the first part, 1 for the second part) at each division.
# TODO: Build the Code Table: Construct a table or dictionary to map each symbol to its corresponding binary code.
# TODO: Encode the Message: Develop a function to encode the input message using the generated code table.
# TODO: Decode the Message: Implement a decoding function that can interpret the binary codes back into the original symbols.
